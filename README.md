## Welcome to mitEngelsk
I offer proofreading on a freelance basis. Proofread final draf5s can be returned to you in as littele as an hour. Drafts can be returned with tracked changes and boxes to accept or deny changes. Care is taken to preserve the substance and meaning of the work. I can help reduce word count, fix grammar issues, expand your vocabulary, tend to structure, and anything else you may need. 

A professional editor can provide:
- Personalised feedback.
- Thorough comments.
- Comments on style.
- Comments on structure.
- Common sense and research used for jargon and technical terms.
- Years of experience and training. Not an algorithm.

Set rate: â‚¬5 per typed page (1.5 lined spacing as per academic regulations). When asking for a free quote, please include the due date.
